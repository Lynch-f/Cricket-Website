        <h1 style="font-size:2.75vw">22/07/2020 Article - Era of Womens Cricket</h1>
        <p>The stage erupts in exuberance. Pink fluffy smoke drifts through the summery air. The voice of Katy Perry
            fills the stadium as she whirls around in her bubblegum dress. Fireworks dart into the Melbourne night sky,
            bursting into streaks of silver. The cheery Australian women fill the platform. Screaming, sobbing and
            giggling, they flaunt the gold around their neck for everyone to see. The freshly cut grass of the Melbourne
            Cricket Ground now lies somewhere beneath layers of gold confetti and streamers. 86,174 fans watch from the
            stands, as Katy Perry and the Australian Women’s Cricket team conclude International Women's Day and a day
            of celebration of women in cricket.</p>
        <p>Despite the splendour of the affair, Women’s Cricket was not always glitz and glamour. Victorious women once
            played in empty stadiums. Their triumphs went unsung. Girls who dreamt of playing for their country were
            given little chance. In recent years, the growth of women’s cricket has been astounding. The Women's T20
            World Cup in March was an attestation to the progression of women's cricket. More than ever before, women’s
            cricket offers soaring attendance and awareness, vast career opportunities and development at grassroots
            level. The prime time to be a female in cricket is undoubtedly now.</p>
        <p>She surveys the packed stadium, surrounded by tens of thousands of fans, all scanning her every move. Flags
            are held high while fans proudly sport their countries jerseys. Some are draped in banners and flags, while
            others are varnished from head to toe in their national colours. The constant commotion is conspicuous.
            Drums pounding, horns tooting and whistles blasting. She pushes aside her emotion before she even begins to
            realise how monumental this moment is for women in cricket.</p>
        <p>Women’s Cricket has had exceptional boosts in attendance and awareness. A sensational 86,174 spectators
            attended the Women's T20 World Cup final in March 2020. With mesmerising performances from local and
            international popstars, such as the well-respected Katy Perry, the night was a hit for many. Women's cricket
            in New Zealand has also had an outstanding progression. Over the 2018/19 season, Sky Sport recorded a
            whopping 70,000 fans tuning in to watch a White Ferns match, making it the largest live attendance for New
            Zealand women’s cricket. Furthermore, the implementation of doubleheaders, White Ferns matches taking place
            prior to BlackCaps matches, has been exceedingly effective in showcasing women's cricket to the mighty men's
            audience. As a result, the White Ferns fan base has grown remarkably. “As a player, I’ve found the attention
            almost overwhelming at times; the number of fans wanting autographs and so on,” said former White Ferns
            captain Suzie Bates. The extensive boost in attendance and awareness for Women's Cricket has been eagerly
            anticipated and simply extraordinary.</p>
        <p>The humming of plane engines rings through her ears. She gazes out of the window and watches as she leaves
            the grassy pastures of New Zealand behind. She takes a minute to let her eyes shut and her mind drift. In
            two days she will arrive in the foreign plains of India to battle the scorching conditions and play in the
            acclaimed Indian Premier League. Not long after that, she will be off again to play county cricket, in the
            picturesque English provinces. A sudden smile sneaks across her face as she grasps that she is finally
            living her dream.</p>
        <p>Women’s Cricket now offers vast career opportunities. New Zealand Cricket recently announced a momentous
            breakthrough for New Zealand White Ferns - professional contracts. Prior to 2019, White Ferns were
            considered only semi-professional athletes. With this introduction comes a fitting rise in salary, with the
            top contract securing $80,000. “This means all White Ferns can now ply their trade as full-time,
            professional cricketers as well as having the flexibility to participate in overseas leagues - which is a
            huge leap forward for all involved,” said White Ferns captain Amy Satterthwaite. Furthermore, many
            commendable cricketing nations have recently launched female brands of flourishing franchises. The Indian
            Premier League is renowned for its high-end player contracts, an exceptional array of talent and
            electrifying atmosphere. The Women's Indian Premier League campaign was only launched in 2019 but appears
            promising given the prosperity of the men's competition. Additionally, numerous other competitions are
            pledging exclusive opportunities for women such as the Australian Big Bash League and the English T20 Blast.
            With these sensational opportunities, women in cricket are sure to thrive.</p>
        <p>The crimson ball swings through the air, as the batter swings and misses. The wooden bails tumble off the
            wickets. She throws her fist in the air and exclaims in sheer jubilation. The cheers of players and parents
            echo through the crisp morning air. An effervescent sense of fulfilment fizzes within her as she struggles
            to contain her exhilaration. Her teammates encompass her, rallying behind her as they celebrate their first
            win as a team.</p>
        <p>Women’s Cricket is equally developing at grassroots level. New Zealand Cricket participation statistics
            illustrate that from 2011/12, female participants have only increased. Like most other countries, New
            Zealand Cricket has been campaigning to popularise cricket to young females and lift the number of girls in
            grassroots cricket. Numerous New Zealand cricket clubs and schools are also onboard to shift their focus to
            facilitate female teams. With this focus, additional resources and efforts are being applied to women's
            grassroots cricket, such as accomplished coaches, diversified teams and state of the art facilities. Females
            are wholeheartedly welcomed into the cricketing environment and are immensely encouraged to play. Cricket is
            a thrilling team sport, which allows young girls to develop their teamwork skills, as well as gaining
            exhilarating on-field experience playing this action-packed sport. Women’s Cricket continues to develop at
            grassroots level to ensure that girls are captivated and uplifted to play.</p>
        <p>“When women’s sports are given media attention, sponsors and marketing they deserve, they thrive,” said
            former American Tennis star, Billie Jean King. In recent years, Women's cricket has accomplished just this.
            With soaring attendance and awareness, vast career opportunities and development at grassroots level,
            women's cricket has and will continue to thrive. Though these progressions are huge steps in the right
            direction, women's cricket, much like other women's sports has still got a long way to go. However, it
            remains explicit that this is the era to be a woman in cricket.</p>
        

        <h1 style="font-size:2.75vw">30/05/2020 Insight - Dealing with an Injury</h1>
        <p>The past six months, have been full of ups and downs thanks to sustaining a season ending injury. During my
            representative tournament, I started to experience a slight pain in my foot but knowing the seriousness and
            importance of the tournament, I decided to push it out of my mind momentarily. After almost 5 months on the
            sideline, I can safely say that was a big mistake. However, it didn't stop there. Having being told by the
            doctors I had only sprained my foot, I took two weeks rest and then continued to play club cricket, only
            making the pain in my foot worse. After a number of ultrasounds, x-rays and CT scans, they confirmed I had a
            stress fracture which immediately cut my season short. On the bright side, after 135 days of being injured I
            have finally been given the all clear. After all this time, it's safe to say I am more than ready to get in
            the nets again. Dealing with an injury has been really difficult at times. From experience, I can say it is
            really hard being patient, knowing your missing out and at the same time there's nothing you can do but wait
            it out. Here are some things I have learnt during this time off:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Be Patient:</b> As hard as it is, being patient is so important. Getting back into the game too
                    early can push you back heaps in terms of recovery. It is key to wait until you are painfree and
                    recovered to play again.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Take the time off:</b> During the season, it can get pretty full on. This means when you have an
                    injury which prevents you from playing, you have a lot more time on your hands. No doubt, I would
                    100% rather be fit and able to play, but there's no point sitting around and getting down about your
                    injury. Take the time off to catch up and do other things. This may be related to cricket or not.
                    For me personally, I got the chance to do both. I used this extra time to catch up with school work,
                    but also spent some time learning more about cricket by watching old games and reading more about
                    cricket. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Be Positive:</b> Think about the future. This could mean thinking long term or short term. Try
                    focusing on next season and what areas you could improve in. It is also important to consider your
                    rehab and how you will work towards getting fit and back into cricket again!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1 style="font-size:2.75vw">06/08/2019 Article - Steady the Ship Kane</h1>
        <p>The crowd roars. The red lights on the bails flicker on. As the opposition rise in a sudden wave of
            triumph,
            we groan in agony watching the fielders celebrating and the batsman walking off. However, fans continue
            to
            wear their sailor hats with pride and wave their flags. Banners are held high with the words “Steady the
            ship” painted in black ink. The music erupts in the background, sending the audience into an ecstatic
            frenzy. Thousands of people watch, clinging to the edge of their seats. A figure emerges out of the
            pavilion, as a ripple of relief washes over the New Zealand fans. Unfazed by the roaring crowds and the
            howling opposition, he makes his way to the middle. We ease ourselves back into our seats because Kane
            Williamson is here, to indeed steady the ship.</p>
        <p>Kane Williamson has represented himself and New Zealand in the best manner. Consequently, he has been
            nominated for the 2020 New Zealander of the Year Award. Williamson’s classy gameplay, his outstanding
            leadership and remarkable sportsmanship qualities all contribute to his overall character. The New
            Zealander
            of the Year Award will acknowledge Williamson’s hard work and give him the recognition he truly
            deserves.
        </p>
        <p>He walks to the crease and takes guard. His eyes dart around, scanning the field and the gaps. The rest
            is
            done simply by him and his bat. The English willow of his bat caresses the leather of the ball,
            strategically manoeuvring it down to the boundary rope. Silence fills the opposition as they stare,
            speechless, and in awe of the class player, they see before them. </p>
        <p>Williamson not only possesses the ability to play an astonishingly picturesque innings, but also the
            ability
            to completely change a game. This has helped him contribute significantly to many Blackcaps victories.
            Williamson has also been consistently technically correct in regards to his gameplay. In the recent One
            Day
            International World Cup, he was recognised as Player of the Tournament, making 578 runs, with a
            staggering
            batting average of 82.57. His orthodox technique and consistency are highly commended by coaches and
            admired
            by critics. Williamson has represented the country exceptionally, and in recent times, he has even
            proved
            the Blackcaps are a force to be reckoned with. He sets a steady example for aspiring cricketers who are
            seeking to refine their technique. Williamson has been exceptional with the bat and sets a high standard
            for
            his team, truly leading from the front. </p>
        <p>Our eyes dart back and forth. The South Africans are buzzing and desperate for a win. Their skipper - Du
            Plessis, hustles around the field hopelessly attempting to figure out how to keep New Zealand below the
            required total. Williamson glances around the ground, remaining calm despite the building atmosphere.
            The
            pressure accumulates as the bowler runs in. Williamson cleanly picks up the slow ball and demolishes it
            into
            the stands for six runs, bringing up his century. He celebrates with a simple raise of the bat, knowing
            the
            job is not done yet. A well-timed cut off the bat then leads New Zealand to win. </p>
        <p>Williamson possesses the ability to remain unbelievably composed but level-headed, despite the incredibly
            pressurising circumstances he is often faced with. No one would suspect that behind his steely eyes, the
            cogs are always turning. Constantly analysing the situation, he comes up with savvy tactics to
            effectively
            influence the match. Williamson's approach to captaincy has also been sharp, but silent. While many
            other
            captains are known for being flamboyant and showy, Williamson’s captaincy has been more unassuming, but
            effective. “Underdogs” is a rather modest label, one that has been given to the Blackcaps who are often
            dangerous when underestimated. “When you look at Kane’s captaincy, I think the team has been shaped in
            his
            image - pretty low-key and humble.” Said former Blackcap Daniel Vettori. With the bat in hand, advising
            the
            bowlers or setting the field, Williamson has truly raised the bar regarding captaincy. Any aspiring
            athletes
            can regard him as a role model because of his composure, level-headedness and humility. </p>
        <p>The crowd is divided. Half rejoice in celebration, while the rest stop and stare, shocked to witness the
            devastating outcome. The West Indian players drop to their knees. They hang their heads in disbelief of
            how
            close they had come, only to be robbed of any chance of qualifying. Tears escape the eyes of Carlos
            Brathwaite and drip down his face, soaking his already drenched shirt. Williamson wanders over to
            Brathwaite
            and lays a hand on his head. He consoles him as fans watch the heartwarming moment, in genuine
            admiration of
            the New Zealand captain.</p>
        <p>Kane Williamson displays outstanding sportsmanship qualities. Comforting Carlos Brathwaite was just one
            of
            the many instances in which Williamson was commended for his outstanding sportsmanship. Throughout the
            tournament, he played fair and within the spirit of cricket. Williamson is also known to lead his team
            to be
            humble in victory and gracious in defeat. This was evident in the agonising One Day International 2019
            World
            Cup Final against England. Though many would insist that the cup was awarded to England unjustly,
            Williamson
            accepted the situation for what it was and even gave England credit for their performance. In the
            post-match
            interview, he said “I have spoken a lot about uncontrollables and there were a couple of today, which
            were
            hard to swallow. England are deserved winners, take nothing away from them - it’s one of those things.”
            Any
            athletes can learn from the exceptional sportsmanship qualities that Williamson displays. </p>
        <p>Since the 2019 One Day International World Cup, Kane Williamson has been in the spotlight. In past years,
            many other New Zealand athletes have been acknowledged for their hard work through the New Zealander of
            the
            Year Award. Kane Williamsons classy game play, outstanding captaincy and remarkable sportsmanship
            qualities
            have stood out on the world stage. Consistency is maintained through all aspects of his game, making him
            a
            sensational role model. Steady the Ship is an understatement for Kane. It is time for our country to
            recognise Kane Williamson as New Zealander of the Year. </p>
