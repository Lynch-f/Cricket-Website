        <p><b>30/05/2020</b></p>
        <p><b>Insight - Dealing with an Injury</b></p>
        <p>The past six months, have been full of ups and downs thanks to sustaining a season ending injury. During my
            representative tournament, I started to experience a slight pain in my foot but knowing the seriousness and
            importance of the tournament, I decided to push it out of my mind momentarily. After almost 5 months on the
            sideline, I can safely say that was a big mistake. However, it didn't stop there. Having being told by the
            doctors I had only sprained my foot, I took two weeks rest and then continued to play club cricket, only
            making the pain in my foot worse. After a number of ultrasounds, x-rays and CT scans, they confirmed I had a
            stress fracture which immediately cut my season short. On the bright side, after 135 days of being injured I
            have finally been given the all clear. After all this time, it's safe to say I am more than ready to get in
            the nets again. Dealing with an injury has been really difficult at times. From experience, I can say it is
            really hard being patient, knowing your missing out and at the same time there's nothing you can do but wait
            it out. Here are some things I have learnt during this time off:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Be Patient:</b> As hard as it is, being patient is so important. Getting back into the game too
                    early can push you back heaps in terms of recovery. It is key to wait until you are painfree and
                    recovered to play again.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Take the time off:</b> During the season, it can get pretty full on. This means when you have an
                    injury which prevents you from playing, you have a lot more time on your hands. No doubt, I would
                    100% rather be fit and able to play, but there's no point sitting around and getting down about your
                    injury. Take the time off to catch up and do other things. This may be related to cricket or not.
                    For me personally, I got the chance to do both. I used this extra time to catch up with school work,
                    but also spent some time learning more about cricket by watching old games and reading more about
                    cricket. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Be Positive:</b> Think about the future. This could mean thinking long term or short term. Try
                    focusing on next season and what areas you could improve in. It is also important to consider your
                    rehab and how you will work towards getting fit and back into cricket again!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>06/08/2019</b></p>
        <p><b>Article - Steady the Ship Kane!</b></p>
        <p>The crowd roars. The red lights on the bails flicker on. As the opposition rise in a sudden wave of
            triumph,
            we groan in agony watching the fielders celebrating and the batsman walking off. However, fans continue
            to
            wear their sailor hats with pride and wave their flags. Banners are held high with the words “Steady the
            ship” painted in black ink. The music erupts in the background, sending the audience into an ecstatic
            frenzy. Thousands of people watch, clinging to the edge of their seats. A figure emerges out of the
            pavilion, as a ripple of relief washes over the New Zealand fans. Unfazed by the roaring crowds and the
            howling opposition, he makes his way to the middle. We ease ourselves back into our seats because Kane
            Williamson is here, to indeed steady the ship.</p>
        <p>Kane Williamson has represented himself and New Zealand in the best manner. Consequently, he has been
            nominated for the 2020 New Zealander of the Year Award. Williamson’s classy gameplay, his outstanding
            leadership and remarkable sportsmanship qualities all contribute to his overall character. The New
            Zealander
            of the Year Award will acknowledge Williamson’s hard work and give him the recognition he truly
            deserves.
        </p>
        <p>He walks to the crease and takes guard. His eyes dart around, scanning the field and the gaps. The rest
            is
            done simply by him and his bat. The English willow of his bat caresses the leather of the ball,
            strategically manoeuvring it down to the boundary rope. Silence fills the opposition as they stare,
            speechless, and in awe of the class player, they see before them. </p>
        <p>Williamson not only possesses the ability to play an astonishingly picturesque innings, but also the
            ability
            to completely change a game. This has helped him contribute significantly to many Blackcaps victories.
            Williamson has also been consistently technically correct in regards to his gameplay. In the recent One
            Day
            International World Cup, he was recognised as Player of the Tournament, making 578 runs, with a
            staggering
            batting average of 82.57. His orthodox technique and consistency are highly commended by coaches and
            admired
            by critics. Williamson has represented the country exceptionally, and in recent times, he has even
            proved
            the Blackcaps are a force to be reckoned with. He sets a steady example for aspiring cricketers who are
            seeking to refine their technique. Williamson has been exceptional with the bat and sets a high standard
            for
            his team, truly leading from the front. </p>
        <p>Our eyes dart back and forth. The South Africans are buzzing and desperate for a win. Their skipper - Du
            Plessis, hustles around the field hopelessly attempting to figure out how to keep New Zealand below the
            required total. Williamson glances around the ground, remaining calm despite the building atmosphere.
            The
            pressure accumulates as the bowler runs in. Williamson cleanly picks up the slow ball and demolishes it
            into
            the stands for six runs, bringing up his century. He celebrates with a simple raise of the bat, knowing
            the
            job is not done yet. A well-timed cut off the bat then leads New Zealand to win. </p>
        <p>Williamson possesses the ability to remain unbelievably composed but level-headed, despite the incredibly
            pressurising circumstances he is often faced with. No one would suspect that behind his steely eyes, the
            cogs are always turning. Constantly analysing the situation, he comes up with savvy tactics to
            effectively
            influence the match. Williamson's approach to captaincy has also been sharp, but silent. While many
            other
            captains are known for being flamboyant and showy, Williamson’s captaincy has been more unassuming, but
            effective. “Underdogs” is a rather modest label, one that has been given to the Blackcaps who are often
            dangerous when underestimated. “When you look at Kane’s captaincy, I think the team has been shaped in
            his
            image - pretty low-key and humble.” Said former Blackcap Daniel Vettori. With the bat in hand, advising
            the
            bowlers or setting the field, Williamson has truly raised the bar regarding captaincy. Any aspiring
            athletes
            can regard him as a role model because of his composure, level-headedness and humility. </p>
        <p>The crowd is divided. Half rejoice in celebration, while the rest stop and stare, shocked to witness the
            devastating outcome. The West Indian players drop to their knees. They hang their heads in disbelief of
            how
            close they had come, only to be robbed of any chance of qualifying. Tears escape the eyes of Carlos
            Brathwaite and drip down his face, soaking his already drenched shirt. Williamson wanders over to
            Brathwaite
            and lays a hand on his head. He consoles him as fans watch the heartwarming moment, in genuine
            admiration of
            the New Zealand captain.</p>
        <p>Kane Williamson displays outstanding sportsmanship qualities. Comforting Carlos Brathwaite was just one
            of
            the many instances in which Williamson was commended for his outstanding sportsmanship. Throughout the
            tournament, he played fair and within the spirit of cricket. Williamson is also known to lead his team
            to be
            humble in victory and gracious in defeat. This was evident in the agonising One Day International 2019
            World
            Cup Final against England. Though many would insist that the cup was awarded to England unjustly,
            Williamson
            accepted the situation for what it was and even gave England credit for their performance. In the
            post-match
            interview, he said “I have spoken a lot about uncontrollables and there were a couple of today, which
            were
            hard to swallow. England are deserved winners, take nothing away from them - it’s one of those things.”
            Any
            athletes can learn from the exceptional sportsmanship qualities that Williamson displays. </p>
        <p>Since the 2019 One Day International World Cup, Kane Williamson has been in the spotlight. In past years,
            many other New Zealand athletes have been acknowledged for their hard work through the New Zealander of
            the
            Year Award. Kane Williamsons classy game play, outstanding captaincy and remarkable sportsmanship
            qualities
            have stood out on the world stage. Consistency is maintained through all aspects of his game, making him
            a
            sensational role model. Steady the Ship is an understatement for Kane. It is time for our country to
            recognise Kane Williamson as New Zealander of the Year. </p>
