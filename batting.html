        <p>Whether you consider yourself a opening batter, a tailender batter, or the one who fields from fine leg to
            fine leg, everyone has to bat in cricket at some point or the other. Therefore, it is vital that every
            cricket player knows the fundamentals to batting. Batting is all about scoring runs. When every you go out
            to bat, your main focus is looking where to score runs. However, not every ball can be scored off and
            therfore, you need to know when to defend a ball. You also need to know how to identify balls that can be
            scored off, and how to score off these balls appropriately. </p>

        <h1 style="font-size:2.75vw">Important Points for Batting</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Grip:</b> Ensure your grip is comfortable and allows you to play various shots. Refer to video
                    below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Stance:</b> Feet should be shoulder width apart. Weight should be evenly balanced and head should
                    be stable so that eyes are level with the bowler running in. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Watch the ball:</b> Watch the ball closely, from the point of release from bowler and play ball
                    under your eyes.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
