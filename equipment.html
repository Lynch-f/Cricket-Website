        <header style="font-size:2.75vw"> BASICS - EQUIPMENT </header>
        
        <p> Cricket often requires a lot of equipment and gear. It is helpful to learn what gear is required and why.
        </p>
        <h1 style="font-size:2.75vw">Basic Equipment List</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Ball:</b> There are also three different game balls which can be used. Red balls are used for most
                    Test Matches played at day, as they are easy to pick up against the white uniforms and also in the
                    sky. Pink balls are used in Test Matches as well, but are used for Day Night games. This means the
                    game is played during the day and into the night. Pink balls are used for these matches as they are
                    easy to see against the white uniforms and also easy to see in the night sky. White balls are used
                    in limited over games (T20S and ODIS) as they are easily seen against the coloured uniforms as well
                    as in the sky. For training purposes, any ball will do but it is important to find out which ball
                    you will playing with during games. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Wickets:</b> Wickets are placed at both ends of the pitch. Generally, wooden wickets are used in
                    competitive games, while metal stumps are used at trainings. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Bat:</b> There are many different bats available. The key to a good bat is ensuring that it is the
                    right height and weight for you personally. Different people also have different preferences in
                    regards to bat weights and brands. Some people prefer heavy bats to assist with powering the ball,
                    while others prefer light bats which allow them to have more control.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Helmet:</b> Helmets are usually required for batters, wicketkeepers and close in fielders.
                    Hemlets are required to protect your head and face from any potential impacts from the cricket ball.
                    They help prevent serious injury, due the hardness of the cricket ball. It is important to make sure
                    your helmet fits properly and is comfortable. Hemlets should be replaced after taking a significant
                    knock from the cricket ball. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Batting Gloves:</b> Batting gloves are worn by the batter to protect their hands from injury. It
                    is important to make sure that the type of Batting Glove you are using is fit for the level of
                    cricket you are playing. Some gloves will have more padding to protect the batter from faster
                    bowling, while others have less padding as less protection is needed as the bowling is not too
                    dangerous.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Batting Inners <i> (Optional)</i> :</b> Batting Inners are thin gloves worn inside the batting
                    gloves to reduce sweat. For some batters, they also help increase their grip of the bat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Arm Guard <i> (Optional)</i> :</b> Arm guards are used by some batters to protect their forearm
                    from impact from the cricket ball.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Abdominal Guard/Box:</b> Abdominal Guards or Box's are worn under cricket pants to protect groin
                    area. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Thigh Guard:</b> Thigh Guards are often worn under cricket pants to protect your thighs from
                    injury from the cricket ball. There are two types of thigh guards - one with two protective paddings
                    (for each thigh) and the other with just one protective padding for the front leg. What type of
                    thigh guard you use is up to you, but it is important to choose a thigh guard which is comfortable
                    and you feel well protected in. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Leg Pads:</b> Leg Pads are worn on the outside of your cricket pants to protect your shins and
                    knees from injury. Leg pads need to be large enough to protect this whole section of your leg,
                    however you should also be able to run comfortably in them. This does take practice to get used to.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Wicketkeeping Gloves:</b> Wicketkeeping Gloves are worn by wicketkeepers to assist them in catch
                    the ball. They are also protective, and reduce the impact of the cricket ball on the wicketkeepers
                    hands. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Wicketkeeping Inners <i> (Optional)</i> :</b> Wicketkeeping Inners are worn by many wicketkeepers
                    to reduce the impact of the cricket ball on their hands. They are thinner than Wicketkeeping Gloves
                    but are padded.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Wicketkeeping Pads:</b> Wicketkeeping pads are very similar to batting pads but are generally
                    thinner and lighter. They are worn by wicketkeepers to protect their shins from impact from the
                    cricket ball but are less padded to allow for flexibility needed for wicketkeeping. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cricket Sunglasses:</b> Many fielders, wicketkeepers and sometimes bowlers (generally spinners)
                    wear sunglasses to reduce the glare of the sun on their eyes, and increase their visibility of the
                    ball. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cricket Shoes:</b> There are many different cricket shoes available. However the most widely used
                    cricket shoes have metal or rubber spikes to prevent slipping on the grass and pitch. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
