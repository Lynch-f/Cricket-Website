            Dictionary of Cricket "The Ashes originated as a result of a satirical obituary published in a British
            newspaper, The Sporting Times, in 1882
            after a match at The Oval in which Australia beat England on an English ground for the first time. The
            obituary stated that English cricket had died, and the body would be cremated and the ashes taken to
            Australia. The English press dubbed the next English tour to Australia (1882â€“83) as the quest to regain The
            Ashes. During that tour a small terracotta urn was presented to England captain Ivo Bligh by a group of
