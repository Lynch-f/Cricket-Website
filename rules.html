        <p> Cricket is played between two teams of 11 players.</p>
        <p> The game of cricket is typically divided into two halves - the first innings and the second innings. In the
            first innings, one team bats whilst the other team bowls and fields. In the second innings, the teams swap
            and the batting team now bowls/fields while the fielding team gets to bat. </p>
        <p> The aim of the <b>batting team</b> is to gather as many runs as they can so that the opposite team will not
            be able
            to beat their score. Two batters will start the game batting and as one batter gets out, another will come
            in to bat until the batting team runs out of players or the overs are completed. Batters a range of
            techniques which allows them to score more runs in specific areas of the field or to combat good bowlers.
        </p>
        <p> The aim of the <b>bowling/fielding team</b> is to stop the batting team from scoring more runs than their
            team.
            This is typically done by taking wickets which means getting the batters out. However there is a range of
            tactics used by the bowling and fielding team to put pressure on the batters and prevent them from scoring
            runs. <b>There are 11 ways to get a batter out, here are the most common:</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><b>Bowled:</b> The bowler's ball hits the batsmens wickets and the bails fall off. This is one of the
                    most
                    common ways batters get out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Caught:</b> The batsmen hits the ball in the air and is caught by a fielder on the full (caught
                    before it
                    hits the ground). There are three ways to get caught:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Caught by fielder: A fielder catches the ball on the full, off the bat. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Caught by wicketkeeper: The ball will usually have a small nick on the bat resulting in it
                            carrying to the wicketkeeper behind the wickets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Caught and bowled: The ball is hit back to the bowler on the full and the bowler who bowled
                            takes the catch</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Stumped:</b> If the batter steps out of crease and misses the ball, the wicketkeeper may dislodge
                    the
                    bails on the wickets resulting in the batter being stumped.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Hit Wicket:</b> If the batter accientally falls, steps or hits the wickets resulting in the bails
                    dislodging, it is considered out.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>LBW (Leg Before Wicket):</b> The bat may fail to make contact with the ball, resulting in the ball
                    hitting the player on the body. If the opposition believes the ball would be going on to hit the
                    wickets if not for the batter, they can appeal to the umpire who may deem the batter out if they
                    agree.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Run Out:</b> The fielding team can attempt to run the batters out by hitting the wickets or
                    dislodging
                    the bails with the ball before the batter returns to their crease. </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
